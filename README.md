# Henry's Bike Shop - Pricing Analysis and Dashboard
This project analyses two years of Henry Bikes ride and cost data to determine an optimal pricing strategy for future revenue and profit growth. After a successful increase in average price from $3.99 to $4.99, the company saw substantial improvements in riders, revenue and profitability. The goal of this analysis is to understand how much additional pricing power exists without reducing overall demand. That is, how can Henry's Bike Shop optimise its ride pricing to maximise profitability while minimising customer churn?

Using raw CSV data, SQL transformation logic and an interactive Power BI dashboard, the project evaluates rider trends, cost structure, price sensitivity and the financial impact of potential price changes. The findings support a recommended price increase in the range of 10 to 15 percent, along with a strategy for segment-based pricing and close performance monitoring. The repository provides all analysis steps and visual outputs needed for transparent review and further decision-making.

This is my first project on GitHub, inspired by a demo from Absent Data.
